Your parents kept drawers full of receipts. You take pictures of reciepts and toss the hard copy
because you're hip and it's the right thing to do.  This app helps you keep track of all of
those photos, and little scraps of info about your house, your car and any other property that
that might need occational maintenance. 

## Motivation

This was built during a one week sprint during a Coding Dojo bootcamp. The goal was to create a fully
functional app highlighting as much of the Django framework as possible.

### Installing

If there a was a requirements.txt... 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

but there isn't a requirements file.  Instead:

```
pip install Django
```

and hope for the best.
